If you aren't going to use Chrome Web Store Payments, you can delay or (for free apps) omit this step.

If you want to charge for your app, set its price and payment system through the dashboard's edit page for your app.

To use Chrome Web Store Payments, you also need to signup your developer account as a Google Checkout merchant, and you need to associate your merchant account with the store. For details, see Register for a [Google Checkout Merchant account](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/money).

Provide store content

Add the store listing information for your app that isn't in the ZIP file, such as a long description, screenshots, videos, and links to related sites. You’ll need the following to finish your app’s store listing:

* A detailed description of your application. Write your description to entice users to download your app.
* A 128x128 icon to display in the store. You may re-use your app icon here.
* At least one 1280x800 or 640x400 screenshot or YouTube video to show off what your app does.
* A 440x280 small tile icon that will be displayed on the Chrome Web Store wall.
* The primary category where your app should be listed.
* Your app's language to help users find it.

Pay the developer signup fee

2. Check that the app and any websites and supporting pages all work.
3. Publish any new websites and supporting pages that your app needs to work.
4. Publish your app.
