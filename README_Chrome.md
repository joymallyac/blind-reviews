 6. Get the app ID
 7. Get the OAuth token
 8. Finish the app
 9. Provide store content
10. Pay the developer signup fee
11. Publish your app

The detail description about each step is given below.

 Create your app’s zip file
 ================================
To upload your app, you need to create a ZIP file that contains at least one file: your app's manifest.

Manifest files are .json files that contain important information about your app. They contain the following:

* App name - Displayed in the Chrome Web Store and in the Chrome launcher
* Version - The version of the metadata, incremented

Create a developer account
================================
If you want to publish a hosted app, you'll need to create a developer acccount with proper credentials.

Upload your app
=================
To upload your app, use the Chrome Developer Dashboard.

If you need the app ID or an OAuth access token to complete your app's code, then you need to upload the app while you're still writing its code. Otherwise, you can wait until the app is finished. You can upload your app many times before publishing it.

When your app, its Chrome Web Store listing, and all the sites it relies on are ready, you can publish your app. You can publish up to 20 applications on Chrome Web Store.

Here's how to upload your app:

1. Go to the [Chrome Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard).

2. Sign into the developer account you chose in Step 1.

3. Click the Add new item button.

4. If you've never uploaded an item before, you need to accept the developer agreement before going to the next step.

5. Click Choose file > your zip file > Upload. If your app's manifest and ZIP file are valid, you can edit your app on the next page.

Pick a payment system
======================
If you aren't going to use Chrome Web Store Payments, you can delay or (for free apps) omit this step.

If you want to charge for your app, set its price and payment system through the dashboard's edit page for your app.

To use Chrome Web Store Payments, you also need to signup your developer account as a Google Checkout merchant, and you need to associate your merchant account with the store. For details, see Register for a [Google Checkout Merchant account](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/money).

Provide store content
======================
Add the store listing information for your app that isn't in the ZIP file, such as a long description, screenshots, videos, and links to related sites. You’ll need the following to finish your app’s store listing:

* A detailed description of your application. Write your description to entice users to download your app.
* A 128x128 icon to display in the store. You may re-use your app icon here.
* At least one 1280x800 or 640x400 screenshot or YouTube video to show off what your app does.
* A 440x280 small tile icon that will be displayed on the Chrome Web Store wall.
* The primary category where your app should be listed.
* Your app's language to help users find it.

Pay the developer signup fee
=============================
Before you publish your first app, you must pay a one-time $5 developer signup fee. A reminder in the dashboard will appear until you pay the fee.

Get app constraints and finish your app’s code
