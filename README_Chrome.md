The detail description about each step is given below.

 Create your app’s zip file
 ================================
To upload your app, you need to create a ZIP file that contains at least one file: your app's manifest.

Manifest files are .json files that contain important information about your app. They contain the following:

* App name - Displayed in the Chrome Web Store and in the Chrome launcher
* Version - The version of the metadata, incremented

Create a developer account
================================
If you want to publish a hosted app, you'll need to create a developer acccount with proper credentials.

Upload your app
=================
To upload your app, use the Chrome Developer Dashboard.

If you need the app ID or an OAuth access token to complete your app's code, then you need to upload the app while you're still writing its code. Otherwise, you can wait until the app is finished. You can upload your app many times before publishing it.

When your app, its Chrome Web Store listing, and all the sites it relies on are ready, you can publish your app. You can publish up to 20 applications on Chrome Web Store.

Here's how to upload your app:

1. Go to the [Chrome Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard).

2. Sign into the developer account you chose in Step 1.

3. Click the Add new item button.

4. If you've never uploaded an item before, you need to accept the developer agreement before going to the next step.

5. Click Choose file > your zip file > Upload. If your app's manifest and ZIP file are valid, you can edit your app on the next page.
